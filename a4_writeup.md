# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Figuring out how to write these different methods and how to write them in the Pythonic way is definitely the most difficult part.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
If you want to add a good computer that actually plays you would need to make it where they make a move based on how you move. But if you want a bad computer it would just place a random X or O depending if it is going first or second in any place.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
You can definitely ask ChatGPT or if there is a website or something that figures out the next best move sort of like how Chess bots do it and implement that into the tic tac toe board so that it can figure out the best moves depending on the moves you make. It will definitely be a lot more simplier than chess since there are less places and moves you can make.
